/*
Dining Philosophers Problem

This is a classic synchronization problem. Imagine you have five philosophers sitting around a table.
Each philosopher has a plate of spaghetti and a fork on each side.
Philosophers can do two things: think or eat.
However, they canâ€™t eat without forks and each philosopher needs both forks to eat their spaghetti.

The challenge is to prevent the philosophers from starving, which happens if they canâ€™t eat,
without getting into a deadlock, where each philosopher picks up one fork and waits forever for the other.

You can use a mutex to represent each fork.
A philosopher can try to lock each mutex (pick up each fork) when they want to eat.
After eating, they will unlock the mutexes (put down the forks).

This problem will help you understand how to use mutexes to handle concurrency and avoid race conditions.
Good luck! ðŸ˜Š
